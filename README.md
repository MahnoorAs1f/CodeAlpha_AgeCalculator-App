Age Calculator

This is a simple and fun little web app that tells you exactly how old you are in years, months, and days. Just pick your date of birth, hit the button, and it does the math for you.

I built it using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The design has a clean card style with a gradient background, smooth animations, and a modern Google font to make it look nice and professional.

It works on both desktop and mobile, so you can quickly check your age anywhere.
